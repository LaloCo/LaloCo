# Hi there 👋, I am Eduardo Rosas, welcome to my GitHub profile

Here are a few things about me:

## What I'm currently coding:

- Some updates to my [Xamarin course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-xamarin-developer-course-ios-and-android)
- Some examples that I am learning from [this](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) three.js course.
- (PAUSED ⏸) 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on a [Flutter app](https://github.com/LaloCo/StockPortfolioCreation_Mobile) that will help investors use the "Magic Formula" (I know, silly name) described by Joel Greenblatt in his book: The Little book that STILL beats the market.
- (PAUSED ⏸)🐍 This project also depends on [this simple Python project](https://github.com/LaloCo/StockPortfolioCreation) which updates the Firestore database the Flutter app uses.

## Where you may find me:
- 👨‍🏫I have [a few courses on mobile app development](https://www.udemy.com/user/eduardorosasosorno/) (now teaching over 60K students) **including two Udemy bestsellers and one highest-rated**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/EduardoRosas) where I talk about personal finance.

## What I would love to learn:
- Machine Learning (I have **very** lightly used Keras, SKLearn & Tensorflow but nothing super exiting)
- Currently learning Mandarin! 🇨🇳
