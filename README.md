### Hi there 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on a [Flutter app](https://github.com/LaloCo/StockPortfolioCreation_Mobile) that will help investors use the "Magic Formula" (I know, silly name) described by Joel Greenblatt in his book: The Little book that STILL beats the market.
- 🐍 This project also depends on [this simple Python project](https://github.com/LaloCo/StockPortfolioCreation) which updates the Firestore database the Flutter app uses.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/EduardoRosas) where I talk about personal finance.
